A collection of general utility and mathematical objects and functions for [GameMaker Studio 2](https://www.yoyogames.com/) (Version 2.3). These mostly consist of utilities that I have found useful during my own game development, and I expect to periodically add more over time.

A [local asset package](https://docs2.yoyogames.com/source/_build/2_interface/2_extras/local_asset_packages.html) containing all scripts can be found on the [releases](https://github.com/adam-rumpf/game-maker-scripts/releases) or from my [itch.io page](https://adam-rumpf.itch.io/gamemaker-studio-2-mathematical-scripts). I encourage you to download it, use it in your own projects, and modify the source code as much as you like.

Each script defines a single function. Most functions are standalone and are meant to be taken Ã  la carte, but some of the more mathematically complicated functions depend on other scripts, indicated in a `@requires` tag.

All function names begin with an underscore (`_`) in order to distinguish them from built-in functions. All object names begin with the `obj_` prefix. Some include methods, which are always defined in the object's Create event.

The following is a brief description of the included functions, divided into rough categories.

## Graph Objects and Functions

Objects and functions for representing graphs and networks (as abstract data structures on the "Instances" layer). The graph objects are meant to act as abstract data structures, and so are included in the `scripts/graph` group alongside the graph functions.

Three main objects, `obj_graph`, `obj_vertex`, and `obj_edge` are defined to represent a graph, its vertices, and its edges, respectively. The main graph object consists mostly of a vertex array and an edge array, but also defines some methods for common graph algorithms (like finding shortest paths). Graphs can technically be defined manually, but it is recommended to instead make use of the included [`_create_graph`](https://github.com/adam-rumpf/game-maker-scripts/blob/master/scripts/_create_graph/_create_graph.gml) function, which automatically defines all necessary objects from an [adjacency list](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adjacency_list) representation and returns the resulting graph object.

It is assumed that all vertices and edges belong to only one graph. Edges are directed, so if you would like for connections to be bidirectional, you must include one edge in each direction.

* [`_create_graph`](https://github.com/adam-rumpf/game-maker-scripts/blob/master/scripts/_create_graph/_create_graph.gml): A function for generating a graph object with accompanying vertex and edge objects from a list of vertex indices and an [adjacency list](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adjacency_list). Optional arguments allow the vertex and edge attributes to be defined.
* `obj_graph`: The main graph object. On destruction, it automatically destroys all associated vertices and edges. Attributes include:
  * `obj_graph.v`: List of vertex objects.
  * `obh_graph.e`: List of edge objects.

  Methods include:
  * [`obj_graph.adjacency_list`](https://github.com/adam-rumpf/game-maker-scripts/blob/master/objects/obj_graph/Create_0.gml#L48): Returns the [adjacency list](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adjacency_list) of the graph, as a list of lists of vertex indices.
  * [`obj_graph.adjacency_matrix`](https://github.com/adam-rumpf/game-maker-scripts/blob/master/objects/obj_graph/Create_0.gml#L11): Returns the [adjacency matrix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adjacency_matrix) of the graph, as a matrix for which element _(i,j)_ indicates the number of edges (or the total weight of edges) from vertex _i_ to vertex _j_.
  * [`obj_graph.all_distances`](https://github.com/adam-rumpf/game-maker-scripts/blob/master/objects/obj_graph/Create_0.gml#L193): Finds the distance from one vertex to every other vertex in the graph (using [Dijkstra's algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dijkstra%27s_algorithm)) based on the `cost` attributes of the edges.
  * [`obj_graph.connected`](https://github.com/adam-rumpf/game-maker-scripts/blob/master/objects/obj_graph/Create_0.gml#L248): Determines whether the graph is (strongly) connected, or whether a given pair of vertices is (strongly) connected.
  * [`obj_graph.distance`](https://github.com/adam-rumpf/game-maker-scripts/blob/master/objects/obj_graph/Create_0.gml#L182): Finds the distance between two vertices (using [Dijkstra's algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dijkstra%27s_algorithm)) based on the `cost` attributes of the edges.
  * [`obj_graph.shortest_path`](https://github.com/adam-rumpf/game-maker-scripts/blob/master/objects/obj_graph/Create_0.gml#L73): Finds the shortest path between a pair of vertices (using [Dijkstra's algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dijkstra%27s_algorithm)) based on the `cost` attributes of the edges. Returns the cost of the path, the sequence of vertices, and the sequence of edges.
* `obj_vertex`: Vertex object. Attributes include:
  * `obj_vertex.e_in`: List of incoming edge objects.
  * `obj_vertex.e_out`: List of outgoing edge objects.
  * `obj_vertex.supply`: Supply value, for potential use in [network flows](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_network) problems.
* `obj_edge`: Edge object. Attributes include:
  * `obj_edge.tail`: Origin vertex object.
  * `obj_edge.head`: Destination vertex object.
  * `obj_edge.cost`: Cost value, for use in minimum-cost path calculation.
  * `obj_edge.capacity`: Capacity value, for potential use in [network flows](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_network) problems.

## File Handling

* [`_ini_keys`](https://github.com/adam-rumpf/game-maker-scripts/blob/master/scripts/_ini_keys/_ini_keys.gml): Finds all keys in a given section of an [INI file](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/INI_file).
