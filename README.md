# GameMaker Scripts

A collection of general utility and mathematical functions for GameMaker Studio 2 (Version 2.3).

All scripts are included in the `scripts/` folder of this repository. Each script defines a single function. Most functions are standalone and are meant to be taken Ã  la carte, but some of the more mathematically complicated functions depend on other scripts, indicated in a `@requires` tag. All function names begin with an underscore (`_`) in order to distinguish them from built-in functions.

The following is a brief description of the included functions, divided into rough categories.

## Array Functions

Common array functions (such as searching and counting).

* [`_array_count`](https://github.com/adam-rumpf/game-maker-scripts/blob/master/scripts/_array_count/_array_count.gml): Counts the number of occurrences of a specified value in an array.
* [`_array_index`](https://github.com/adam-rumpf/game-maker-scripts/blob/master/scripts/_array_index/_array_index.gml): Finds the first index at which a specified value occurs in an array (or -1 if not found). An optional argument allows the search to begin with a specified index.
* [`_array_max`](https://github.com/adam-rumpf/game-maker-scripts/blob/master/scripts/_array_max/_array_max.gml): Returns the maximum value (or the index of the maximum value) in an array.
* [`_array_min`](https://github.com/adam-rumpf/game-maker-scripts/blob/master/scripts/_array_min/_array_min.gml): Returns the minimum value (or the index of the minimum value) in an array.
* [`_invert_permutation`](https://github.com/adam-rumpf/game-maker-scripts/blob/master/scripts/_invert_permutation/_invert_permutation.gml): Generates a permutation array to invert a given permutation array.
* [`_linspace`](https://github.com/adam-rumpf/game-maker-scripts/blob/master/scripts/_linspace/_linspace.gml): Generates an array with a specified number of equally-spaced values that cover a specified range.
* [`_permute`](https://github.com/adam-rumpf/game-maker-scripts/blob/master/scripts/_permute/_permute.gml): Permutes the elements of an array according to a given permutation array.
* [`_range`](https://github.com/adam-rumpf/game-maker-scripts/blob/master/scripts/_range/_range.gml): Generates an array of equally-spaced values over a specified range with a specified step size.

## Computational Mathematics Functions

Numerical algorithms for computational mathematics.

* [`_root_bisection`](https://github.com/adam-rumpf/game-maker-scripts/blob/master/scripts/_root_bisection/_root_bisection.gml): Finds a function root on a specified interval using the bisection method.
* [`_root_newton`](https://github.com/adam-rumpf/game-maker-scripts/blob/master/scripts/_root_newton/_root_newton.gml): Finds a function root given a derivative and an initial guess using Newton's method.

## Linear Algebra Functions

Common linear algebra algorithms for dealing with matrices and vectors. In all functions, _vectors_ are considered to be 1D arrays while _matrices_ are 2D arrays.

* [`_linear_solve`](https://github.com/adam-rumpf/game-maker-scripts/blob/master/scripts/_linear_solve/_linear_solve.gml): Solves a linear system given a coefficient matrix and righthand vector (using Gaussian elimination with partial pivoting).
* [`_matrix_multiply`](https://github.com/adam-rumpf/game-maker-scripts/blob/master/scripts/_matrix_multiply/_matrix_multiply.gml): Performs matrix-matrix, matrix-vector, and vector-vector multiplication.
* [`_matrix_transpose`](https://github.com/adam-rumpf/game-maker-scripts/blob/master/scripts/_matrix_transpose/_matrix_transpose.gml): Transposes a 2D matrix.
* [`_tridiagonal_solve`](https://github.com/adam-rumpf/game-maker-scripts/blob/master/scripts/_tridiagonal_solve/_tridiagonal_solve.gml): Solves a tridiagonal system (using the Thomas algorithm).
* [`_triangular_solve`](https://github.com/adam-rumpf/game-maker-scripts/blob/master/scripts/_triangular_solve/_triangular_solve.gml): Solves an upper or lower triangular system (using forward or back substitution).
* [`_unit_vector`](https://github.com/adam-rumpf/game-maker-scripts/blob/master/scripts/_unit_vector/_unit_vector.gml): Defines a unit direction vector between two coordinates.
* [`_vector_angle`](https://github.com/adam-rumpf/game-maker-scripts/blob/master/scripts/_vector_angle/_vector_angle.gml): Calculates the acute angle between two vectors.
* [`_vector_distance`](https://github.com/adam-rumpf/game-maker-scripts/blob/master/scripts/_vector_distance/_vector_distance.gml): Calculates the Lp-distance between two vectors.
* [`_vector_norm`](https://github.com/adam-rumpf/game-maker-scripts/blob/master/scripts/_vector_norm/_vector_norm.gml): Calculates the Lp-norm of a vector.
* [`_vector_rotate`](https://github.com/adam-rumpf/game-maker-scripts/blob/master/scripts/_vector_rotate/_vector_rotate.gml): Rotates a 2D vector by a specified angle.
* [`_vector_scale`](https://github.com/adam-rumpf/game-maker-scripts/blob/master/scripts/_vector_scale/_vector_scale.gml): Scales a vector to maintain its direction while giving it a specified norm.

## Random Functions

Functions which involve randomization.

* [`_random_weighted_index`](https://github.com/adam-rumpf/game-maker-scripts/blob/master/scripts/_random_weighted_index/_random_weighted_index.gml): Chooses a random array index with probabilities defined by a given weight array.
* [`_random_sample`](https://github.com/adam-rumpf/game-maker-scripts/blob/master/scripts/_random_sample/_random_sample.gml): Draws a set of random samples from an array, either with or without replacement.
